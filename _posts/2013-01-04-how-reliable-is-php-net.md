## How reliable is _php.net_? {reliability_of_phpnet}

Php is maybe the most documented programming language in the world. **Php.net is the best resource to understand how php the default php functionality**. Still php MUST NOT be used as your only learning resource for various reasons.

Sometimes the default functionality is not the best and there are many php tricks to try that can work better. They are usually noted in the coments but the comments themselves are not a reliable source of learning.

As of any documentation, php.net lacks some documents and have others outdated. They are a minority but its always a good idea to cross references with other documents.

Php.net focus on explaining the way the language works and it expressively avoids important topics such as dessign patterns, code documentation, version management, best practices etc.

In resume use php.net as your main resource but not as your only resource.
