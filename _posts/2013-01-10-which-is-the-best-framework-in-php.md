## Which is the best framework (or better said why I must not ask that question)
It depends on the work you want to accomplish. There are lots of PHP Framework around the web. Just read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#PHP_2 and think what should be fit for your project. Choosing framework is totally dependent on your project types. So you know better what fits for you.
